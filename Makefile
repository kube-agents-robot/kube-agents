# Unit tests for every Python helper outside k8s-operator/, which has its own
# target. Mostly stdlib-only -- the skill helpers shell out to gh/kubectl
# rather than importing SDKs -- but the agent scripts do import a few third
# party packages, listed in requirements-test.txt and installed by
# `make test-python-deps`. CI installs the same file.
#
# The wildcards are what keep this honest: a new skill's tests are picked up
# without editing this file. Thirteen globs rather than one because the tests do
# not all live under skills -- the admin console, the shared agent scripts,
# Chat Agent plugins and hooks, image patches, image build and repository
# tooling in scripts/ each hold their own. scripts/ is here
# because it was not: the tests for the upstream-skill sync sat outside every
# glob, so they had never once run in CI. defaults/hooks is here for the same
# reason -- the plugins glob does not reach it, so the chat_message_audit hook
# was untestable-by-CI however many tests it grew. Discovery is then run once
# per directory rather than once over the tree, because most of them are not
# packages (incident_context is the exception, and per-directory discovery
# still collects it) -- `unittest discover` pointed at agents/platform/skills finds
# nothing and still exits 0, which reads as a passing suite. That also keeps
# deploy/docker, deploy/docker/patches and each deploy/docker/plugins/<name>
# separate, which they must be: those tests import their subject by bare module
# name, which only resolves with their own directory as the discovery root.
#
# tests/integration is the newest entry and the only one that is not a unit
# suite. It ran alone in its own CI job through a probation period, so that a
# flake in a young seam test could not red an already-gating job; it finished
# that period without a single failure, and a tier nothing gates on is a tier
# people learn to merge around. It is deterministic by construction -- real
# components, no model calls -- so it belongs in the sweep the `test` job runs
# rather than beside it. The one thing that costs: the injector seam shells out
# to `go test`, so every job that expands this list needs a Go toolchain on
# PATH or those tests skip themselves and the sweep reports green without them.

# What both callers of the sweep below -- test-python and coverage -- export as
# PYTHONPATH, prepended to whatever the caller already has. Declared once
# because the two had already drifted: coverage exported only $(CURDIR), so it
# resolved imports differently from the suite it claims to mirror. Nothing
# depended on the difference yet, which is exactly why it went unnoticed -- the
# coverage target tolerates a failing directory, so a test that needed the
# missing entries would have been swallowed by the "failing test directories"
# note. Now that the same run produces the required verdict, that drift would
# read as a test that passes locally under `make test-python` and fails in CI.
#
# Sharing the sweep made the discovery structural; this makes the environment it
# runs in structural too, which is the other half of measuring the same suite.

# How many of those directories `test-python` and `coverage` run at once. They
# are separate `python3` processes that share nothing -- each cd's into its own
# directory, servers in the seam tier bind port 0, and fixtures go through
# tempfile -- so the sweep costs its slowest single directory rather than the
# sum of all of them. Four directories are most of that sum, so the win is
# large and then flat: raising this past a handful buys nothing.
#
# Set it to 1 to serialise. That is for reproducing a failure you suspect is
# concurrency's doing, or for a machine you need the cores back on -- not for
# readability, since the sweep captures each directory's output either way:
#   make test-python PYTHON_TEST_JOBS=1
PYTHON_TEST_JOBS ?= $(shell nproc 2>/dev/null || echo 4)

# The sweep over PYTHON_TEST_DIRS that `test-python` and `coverage` both run.
# $(1) is the command executed inside each directory, and it is the only thing
# the two callers differ by.
#
# One macro rather than two loops because that mirroring is load-bearing and
# used to be only asserted in a comment: a coverage target that walks the
# directories differently measures a different suite than the one that gates,
# and nothing would say so. Sharing the sweep makes it structural.
#
# Contract: leaves `$$failed` set to a space-separated list of the directories
# whose command exited non-zero, empty when none did. The caller decides what
# that means -- test-python exits 1, coverage prints a note and carries on.
#
# Two properties the sequential loop had, kept by different means now that the
# directories run concurrently. Every directory still runs even after another
# fails: xargs keeps going, and each worker records its own verdict in a file
# because a variable assigned in a subprocess cannot come back to the parent.
# And each directory's output still arrives as a labelled block, because it is
# captured to its own file and printed afterwards in PYTHON_TEST_DIRS order --
# concurrent writers to one stream interleave mid-line and the "==> dir" headers
# stop meaning anything. What that costs is progress, and a run killed mid-sweep
# (a CI cancellation, a step timeout) loses the captured output entirely, so
# each worker prints a line as it finishes to leave something behind.
#
# The verdict file is per-directory and read as fail-closed: a directory whose
# .rc is missing or non-zero counts as failed. One shared append-only file would
# be shorter, but a failed append -- a full TMPDIR, which 25 concurrent suites
# make likelier than the old loop did -- would silently drop a red directory and
# let the gate pass. Absence has to mean failure, not success.
#
# $(1) is interpolated into a single-quoted sh -c string, so it must not contain
# a single quote. It also must not contain a comma: $(call) splits arguments on
# commas before the body ever sees them, so `python3 -c "import os, sys"` would
# arrive silently truncated at the comma. Both callers avoid each.

# Coverage runs the same suite the same way -- literally the same sweep as
# test-python, through sweep_python_test_dirs, with `coverage run` in place of
# `python3`. That mirroring is the point: a coverage target that discovers tests
# any other way measures a different suite. Two things differ. COVERAGE_ROOT
# pins the measured tree to the repository root (the sweep cd's into each
# directory, and .coveragerc reads the variable because `source` cannot be
# relative from seventeen places), and COVERAGE_FILE parks every per-directory
# data file in one place for `coverage combine`. By default a failing directory
# is reported but does not stop the measurement, so a red directory cannot hide
# the number for the others.
#
# Concurrency needs nothing extra here: .coveragerc already sets parallel = True,
# so each process writes its own data file suffixed with host and pid and the
# `coverage combine` below merges them. That setting was there for the
# per-directory loop, and it is the same property concurrent directories need.
#
# COVERAGE_STRICT=1 makes the target fail at the end when any directory failed,
# which is what lets one run serve as both the verdict and the meter. CI's
# required job sets it, so a pull request pays for the 5638 tests once instead
# of running them again unmeasured in a second job. The default stays 0 because
# a local run against a tree with known-red directories should still print a
# total. The failing list travels through a file because each recipe line is its

# bench/tests is the one Python suite that cannot join PYTHON_TEST_DIRS: it is
# pytest-native (fixtures, parametrize), and `unittest discover` collects two
# of its tests and errors on both. So it runs under its own target, and
# scripts/test_test_discovery.py keeps the exclusion explicit rather than an
# accident of the globs above.
# pyyaml is a test-only dependency and is named here rather than in bench's
# runtime `dependencies`: the harness never parses a task.yaml itself (devops-
# bench does that before any of this package is imported). One test reads the
# specs directly -- the roster-collision sweep in tests/test_verifiers.py,
# which has to see every task's phrases at once -- so the parser belongs with
# the test runner. Keep in step with bench/pyproject.toml's `dev` group.
test-bench-deps: ## Install what `make test-bench` needs: bench/ editable plus pytest and pyyaml. Resolves devops-bench from the git SHA pinned in bench/pyproject.toml, so the first run needs network.

test-bench: ## Run the bench harness tests under pytest.
	@python3 -m pytest bench/tests/

# A broken bench case otherwise costs a full presubmit to discover: provision,
# deploy, run the agent, score, read the log. Most of the ways a task.yaml is
# broken are static -- an unknown domain slug, a fixture role the seeded fleet
# never planted, a check with no assertion, a case in no TASKS entry -- so they
# fail here in a second instead. The same rules gate in CI through
# scripts/test_task_registration.py; this target is the fast path to them.

# The integration tier: real components wired together with the agent replaced
# by a fake -- no model calls, deterministic by construction (strategy 4.1b).
# The tier now gates: tests/integration is in PYTHON_TEST_DIRS, so `make
# test-python` and the CI `test` job both run it, and a red seam test is a red
# pull request. This target is a convenience for running that one tier while
# you work on a seam -- seconds instead of the whole sweep -- and is not what
# CI invokes, so do not reach for it as the definition of what must pass.
# Install a Go toolchain before trusting a green run here: the injector seam
# compiles the real Go client, and without `go` on PATH it skips itself rather
# than failing, which reads exactly like a pass.

# The agent's own instructions are prose, and prose is not compiled: a persona

# Not folded into docs-check: these files are runtime assets rather than

# cites them. CI runs it as its own job in validate.yml, alongside the other
