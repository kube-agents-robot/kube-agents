# Syncs the Helm chart's copies of operator-owned manifests from their source
# of truth under k8s-operator/config/:
#   - charts/kube-agents/crds/*.yaml are verbatim copies of config/crd/bases/.
#   - The ClusterRole rules in templates/operator-rbac.yaml are spliced from
#     config/rbac/role.yaml between the GENERATED RULES markers.
#   - templates/agent-rbac-admission-policy.yaml is config/admission/agent-rbac-policy.yaml
#     wrapped in the chart's values gate. The chart is the only thing that installs those
#     policies, so a drifted copy is a backstop nobody applies.
#   - templates/operator-webhooks.yaml is hand-maintained (the chart adds values gates and
#     the cert-manager objects), so it is compared rather than rewritten:
#     hack/check_chart_webhooks.py renders it and diffs the webhooks and Service
#     targetPort against config/webhook. Sync mode only prints a reminder.
# Run with --check (CI, `make chart-check`) to fail instead of rewriting.
