`kube-agents` follows strict [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) without a `v` prefix for official releases across container images, OCI Helm charts, and Terraform modules.

The release pipeline guarantees that installer scripts (`install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, `upgrade.sh`) and container runtime images are bit-for-bit synchronized from the exact same commit and, absent an emergency bypass, validated on a live GKE cluster before any release tag is published.

## Tag and artifact taxonomy

Every commit and build progresses through five distinct lifecycle tiers:

| Tier                       | Format                                | Trigger                       | Purpose and guarantees                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Candidate Build**        | `<COMMIT_SHA>` (bare 40-char SHA)     | Push to `main` branch         | Developer build in GHCR; container images built once.                                                                  |
| **Release Candidate (RC)** | `rc_YYMMDDHHMM_<SHORT_SHA>`           | 3-hour cron / manual dispatch | Candidate build selected for live cluster testing.                                                                     |
| **RC Validated**           | `rc_YYMMDDHHMM_<SHORT_SHA>_validated` | Successful GKE E2E suite      | Quality gate: proof that `install.sh` succeeded on a real GKE cluster.                                                 |
| **Staging Promoted**       | `staging_YYMMDDHHMM_<SHORT_SHA>`      | Successful nightly matrix     | Quality gate for GA: the full nightly E2E matrix passed on the commit. Also the deploy trigger for the staging estate. |
| **GA Stable**              | `X.Y.Z` (pure numeric SemVer)         | Weekly cron / manual dispatch | Official production release tagged on a stamped commit parented by the target commit (staging-promoted by default).    |

Only a staging-promoted commit is releasable. An `rc_*_validated` tag records the narrow
three-hourly suite; the GA gate reads the `staging_<ts>_<sha>` tag that `nightly-pipeline.yml`
pushes after the full matrix passes
([`scripts/release/README.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/scripts/release)).
The gate matches that tag's shape rather than the bare `staging_` prefix, because the prefix is
also a hand-pushable redeploy trigger.

## Release cadence

The RC pipeline, the nightly staging promotion, and the GA release all run on schedules,
with manual dispatches available for overrides and off-schedule releases.

| Step                        | When it runs                                                                                                  | Workflow                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RC selection and validation | Every three hours, at 17 minutes past. Dispatches nothing when the newest candidate has already been tried.   | `rc-scheduler.yml` starts `rc-release-pipeline.yml`, which pushes the `rc_*` and `rc_*_validated` tags.                           |
| Staging promotion           | Daily at 02:17 UTC, against the newest validated candidate. One already promoted is re-tested, not re-tagged. | `nightly-scheduler.yml` starts `nightly-pipeline.yml`, which pushes the `staging_<ts>_<sha>` tag when the full E2E matrix passes. |
| GA release                  | Weekly on Fridays at 05:17 UTC, or when a maintainer dispatches it; `release-publish.yml` has no `schedule:`. | `release-scheduler.yml` starts `release-publish.yml` with `schedule_gate=evaluate` when an eligible staging candidate is found.   |

Scheduled runs start when GitHub's scheduler picks them up, so the minute is a floor, not a
promise. A scheduled GA release ships unattended on Fridays if a new staging-promoted
candidate exists, or maintainers may dispatch the workflow by hand. The gate that decides whether
a dispatch publishes, and how the schedulers pick a candidate, are described in
[`scripts/release/README.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/scripts/release),
which is canonical for both.

### What the next release contains

Generated release notes are the tracking mechanism. GitHub milestones are unused.

Every GA release is created with `gh release create --generate-notes`
(`scripts/release/publish_github_release.sh`), so GitHub writes the notes from the pull requests
merged between the previous release tag and the new one, grouped under the label categories in
`.github/release.yml`: features, bug fixes, security, documentation, infrastructure, and a
catch-all for anything else. The script names the previous GA tag itself with `--notes-start-tag`
rather than leaving GitHub to pick one;
[`scripts/release/README.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/scripts/release)
says why. Dependabot's pull requests, and any labelled `duplicate`, `invalid` or `wontfix`, are
left out. Read them on
[the releases page](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/releases) once the release exists.

Before it exists, the next release is whatever has merged since the latest GA tag, which
[the latest release](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/releases/latest) names:

- `https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/compare/<LATEST_GA_TAG>...main` lists every pull
  request the next release will contain if it is cut from the tip of `main`. The GA tag sits on a
  stamped commit whose parent is the released candidate, so the three-dot compare starts from that
  candidate.
- Replace `main` with the newest `staging_<ts>_<sha>` tag to see what is releasable now; that is
  the commit an ordinary dispatch releases.

`auto-assign-milestone.yml` still runs after every merge to `main`, but it exits without assigning
anything when the repository has no open milestone, and none is kept, so a milestone is not where
to look.

## Automated SemVer 2.0 calculation

When the GA release workflow runs, `scripts/release/calculate_next_version.sh` inspects Conventional Commits in the range `<LATEST_GA_TAG>..<TARGET_COMMIT>` (resolving to the latest staging-promoted commit on the standard automated path, or the specified commit / `HEAD` under emergency bypass):

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Commit type in release range | Current version | Calculated next version | Precedence and action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `perf:` | `0.2.0` | `0.2.1` | Patch bump |
| `feat:` | `0.2.0` | `0.3.0` | Minor bump, Patch resets to 0 |
| `feat!:`, `fix!:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:` | `0.2.0` | `0.3.0` | Minor bump (SemVer 2.0 Clause 4 in `0.y.z`) |
| `feat!:`, `fix!:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:` | `1.2.0` | `2.0.0` | Major bump (in `1.x.x`+) |
| _(No new commits in release range)_ | `0.2.0` | `0.2.0` | No changes (`skip_release=true`) |

### SemVer 2.0 Clause 4 and the 1.0.0 manual governance rule

During initial development (`0.y.z`), any breaking change increments `MINOR` (`0.2.1` -> `0.3.0`) and resets `PATCH` to 0, per [SemVer 2.0 Clause 4](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

The automated version calculator never promotes `0.y.z` to `1.0.0` on its own. Declaring API stability and graduating to `1.0.0` is a manual governance decision by project maintainers, triggered explicitly through the `explicit_release_version: "1.0.0"` workflow input.

Once `1.0.0` is established, the automated calculator resumes standard SemVer rules: breaking changes bump `MAJOR`, new features bump `MINOR`, and bug fixes bump `PATCH`.

## Cutting a GA release

### Prerequisites

Before triggering a production release:

1. Target commit must exist on the `main` branch.
2. Target commit must carry a `staging_<ts>_<sha>` tag created by the nightly promotion pipeline ([`scripts/release/README.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/scripts/release)). An `rc_*_validated` tag is not checked alongside it: a staging tag is only ever derived from a candidate that already carries one.
3. All four required container images (`k8s-operator`, `platform-agent`, `credential-proxy`, `replay-proxy`) must exist in GHCR under `<TARGET_COMMIT>`.
4. GitHub CLI (`gh`) version 2.40.0 or newer installed and authenticated with `repo` and `workflow` permissions (`gh auth status`).

### Triggering the release workflow

Execute `.github/workflows/release-publish.yml` from the GitHub Actions web interface or via the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Standard automated release (SemVer calculated automatically from Conventional Commits):
gh workflow run release-publish.yml --repo gke-labs/kube-agents

# Releasing a specific staging-promoted commit:
gh workflow run release-publish.yml --repo gke-labs/kube-agents \
  -f target_commit="<TARGET_COMMIT_SHA>"

# Manual version override (e.g. promoting 0.y.z to 1.0.0):
gh workflow run release-publish.yml --repo gke-labs/kube-agents \
  -f explicit_release_version="1.0.0"
```

Scheduled releases are automated weekly on Fridays at 05:17 UTC via
`.github/workflows/release-scheduler.yml` using the decoupled trigger pattern.
The publishing workflow itself (`release-publish.yml`) has no `schedule:` and is dispatch-only:
when the scheduler finds an eligible staging-promoted candidate, it dispatches the workflow with
`schedule_gate=evaluate`. In pre-1.0 initial development (`0.y.z`), breaking changes bump minor
under SemVer Clause 4 and release unattended. Once `1.0.0` is cut, a breaking change halts the
scheduled evaluation with an error annotation so maintainers can publish the major release by hand.
Manual releases and emergency bypasses remain supported on `release-publish.yml` using
`schedule_gate=bypass` (the default). `dry-run` reports the verdict in the job summary and
publishes nothing.
[`scripts/release/README.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/scripts/release) is
canonical for that gate; [Release cadence](#release-cadence) above states when each step runs.

## Emergency hotfix runbook

The release gatekeeper enforces staging promotion (`staging_<ts>_<sha>`, the full nightly GKE E2E matrix) by default. In emergency situations, maintainers can bypass the live GKE validation gate while preserving all cryptographic and build integrity invariants.

### Eligibility criteria

Emergency gate bypass (`skip_staging_validation: true`) is strictly reserved for two scenarios: zero-day CVE vulnerabilities in container dependencies requiring immediate publication, or critical production regressions where waiting for the next nightly promotion or cluster provisioning would prolong user-facing downtime.

### Enforced security invariants

Even during an emergency bypass, the pipeline enforces three hard safety barriers:

1. `scripts/release/verify_release_eligibility.sh` checks that all four container images (`k8s-operator`, `platform-agent`, `credential-proxy`, `replay-proxy`) exist in GHCR under `<TARGET_COMMIT>`. Releases of unbuilt commits hard-fail.
2. `emergency_override_reason` must contain a non-whitespace justification; empty or whitespace-only reasons abort the workflow (`exit 1`).
3. Target SemVer tags must not already exist on another commit; tag collisions abort the release.

### Executing an emergency hotfix

To publish an emergency release via the GitHub CLI. Always specify `target_commit` to pin the exact hotfix commit SHA; omitting `target_commit` causes the workflow to default to the tip of `main` (`HEAD`), releasing all intervening commits without prior GKE E2E validation:

```bash
# Emergency release from a specific commit SHA (version calculated automatically):
gh workflow run release-publish.yml --repo gke-labs/kube-agents \
  -f skip_staging_validation=true \
  -f emergency_override_reason="CVE-2026-XXXX: Critical vulnerability in base container dependencies" \
  -f target_commit="<HOTFIX_COMMIT_SHA>"

# Emergency release from a specific commit SHA with explicit SemVer override:
gh workflow run release-publish.yml --repo gke-labs/kube-agents \
  -f skip_staging_validation=true \
  -f emergency_override_reason="Critical regression fix for gateway admission deadlock" \
  -f target_commit="<HOTFIX_COMMIT_SHA>" \
  -f explicit_release_version="0.3.1"
```

### Post-release reconciliation

After an emergency publication, complete these three reconciliation steps:

1. Confirm the published release tag, container images in GHCR, and signed Helm OCI chart via `gh release view <VERSION>`.
2. Manually trigger `.github/workflows/rc-release-pipeline.yml` against the hotfix commit (`-f commit_sha="<HOTFIX_COMMIT_SHA>"`, matching the SHA passed as `target_commit`) to run the full GKE E2E suite and ensure the fix validates cleanly on live infrastructure. Do not pass the tagged release commit: `tag_ga_release.sh` creates a stamped release commit on detached HEAD that lacks SHA-tagged container images in GHCR, causing the RC pipeline's image verification step to fail.
3. Attach the GitHub Actions run URL and emergency justification to the corresponding tracking issue or incident report.

## Clean promotion and artifact guarantees

The release publish workflow enforces byte-for-byte fidelity with tested candidate binaries across seven layers:

1. Container images are compiled only once on push to `main`. `scripts/release/promote_release_images.sh` retags existing `<TARGET_COMMIT>` manifests to numeric `X.Y.Z` in GHCR using `docker buildx imagetools create`.
2. Promoted container images in GHCR are cryptographically signed using Keyless Cosign via GitHub Actions OIDC tokens (`scripts/release/sign_release_images.sh`).
3. `scripts/release/publish_helm_chart.sh` packages `charts/kube-agents` at version `X.Y.Z` (matching `appVersion`), pushes the OCI package to `oci://ghcr.io/gke-labs/kube-agents/charts/kube-agents:X.Y.Z`, and signs the OCI manifest via Cosign.
4. `scripts/release/tag_ga_release.sh` creates a single-parent release commit on detached HEAD, stamps `BAKED_RELEASE_VERSION="X.Y.Z"` into root scripts (`install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, `upgrade.sh`), updates Helm chart versions (`charts/kube-agents/Chart.yaml`), stamps Terraform default image tags (`terraform/examples/full-install/variables.tf`, `terraform.tfvars.example`), and tags the stamped commit.
5. `verify_local_source_ref` in `install.sh` and `upgrade.sh` verifies that unversioned source directories match `BAKED_RELEASE_VERSION` and that Git checkouts match the requested tag commit SHA, halting execution if local scripts diverge from container images.
6. `scripts/release/package_release_bundle.sh` stages an offline release bundle directly from the tagged release commit using `git archive`, writes the `.release-bundle` provenance marker, and packages both `.tar.gz` and `.zip` archives.
7. `scripts/release/generate_release_sbom.sh` uses Syft to generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) in both SPDX 2.3 JSON and CycloneDX 1.5 JSON formats for filesystem assets and OCI container images, published alongside `checksums.txt` containing SHA256 checksums for all release assets.

## Offline distribution bundles and SBOMs

For air-gapped or restricted network environments where cloning the repository or pulling directly from GitHub is disallowed, official releases provide pre-packaged distribution bundles and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

### Distribution bundle assets

Each GA release attaches the following distribution artifacts to the GitHub Release:

- `kube-agents-<VERSION>.tar.gz` and `kube-agents-<VERSION>.zip`: Complete, self-contained offline distribution bundles containing Terraform provisioning modules (`terraform/`), Kubernetes operator manifests (`k8s-operator/`), deployment configs (`deploy/`), Helm charts (`charts/`), utility scripts (`scripts/`), examples (`examples/`), installer scripts (`install.sh`, `upgrade.sh`, `uninstall.sh`), and the mirrored image catalog (`images.json`). Tracked example files (`terraform.tfvars.example`) are preserved, while sensitive tokens and local caches are sanitized.
- `kube-agents-<VERSION>.tgz`: Packaged Helm chart with matching `version` and `appVersion`.
- `kube-agents-<VERSION>.spdx.json` and `kube-agents-<VERSION>.cdx.json`: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the filesystem bundle in SPDX 2.3 and CycloneDX 1.5 JSON formats.
- `k8s-operator-<VERSION>.spdx.json`, `platform-agent-<VERSION>.spdx.json`, `credential-proxy-<VERSION>.spdx.json`, `replay-proxy-<VERSION>.spdx.json`: Container image SBOMs in SPDX 2.3 JSON format generated by Syft for each of the four release images.
- `checksums.txt`: SHA256 cryptographic checksums covering all distribution tarballs, zips, charts, and SBOM JSON files.
- `checksums.txt.bundle`: Keyless Cosign signature bundle attesting to the provenance and authenticity of `checksums.txt` signed via GitHub Actions OIDC.

### Provenance attribution and `.release-bundle` marker

Every packaged release bundle contains a `.release-bundle` metadata file at its root, attesting to the release provenance:

```ini
name=kube-agents
version=<VERSION>
tag=<VERSION>
commit=<STAMPED_RELEASE_COMMIT_SHA>
build_date=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
```

The `commit` field records the SHA of the tagged release commit (the single-parent stamped commit created on detached HEAD parented by the candidate commit).

When `install.sh` or `upgrade.sh` executes from an unversioned directory outside Git, `verify_local_source_ref` verifies source integrity in two steps:

1. `BAKED_RELEASE_VERSION` stamped into the script must match the requested release ref (passed via `--image-tag`, defaulting to the script's own version).
2. If `.release-bundle` is present with matching `version` or `tag`, it attributes the source directory to the official release bundle and logs:

```text
✓ Verified install sources match official release bundle <VERSION>.
```

(or `✓ Verified upgrade sources match official release bundle <VERSION>.` during upgrades). If the marker is missing but `BAKED_RELEASE_VERSION` matches, it reports matching the baked release.

### Verifying release bundle integrity and provenance

Consumers can verify both the cryptographic provenance and integrity of downloaded release assets. First, verify the authenticity of `checksums.txt` using Keyless Cosign:

```bash
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle checksums.txt.bundle \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "^https://github\.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  checksums.txt
```

Once `checksums.txt` is verified against GitHub Actions OIDC provenance, verify downloaded files against the checksums:

```bash
sha256sum -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
```

### Inspecting Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

SBOMs are generated using Syft and can be inspected using standard security and compliance tooling:

```bash
# Inspect filesystem package inventory from SPDX SBOM using jq:
jq '.packages[] | {name: .name, version: .versionInfo, license: .licenseConcluded}' kube-agents-<VERSION>.spdx.json

# Inspect filesystem components in CycloneDX format:
jq '.components[] | {name: .name, version: .version, type: .type}' kube-agents-<VERSION>.cdx.json

# Inspect container image packages (e.g. operator runtime dependencies):
jq '.packages[] | {name: .name, version: .versionInfo}' k8s-operator-<VERSION>.spdx.json
```

## Helm chart versioning

The chart `version` tracks the application `appVersion`: the release workflow packages the
chart with both `version` and `appVersion` set to the exact SemVer release tag `X.Y.Z`, so every
chart release corresponds to exactly one application release. There is no chart-only release
train — a chart-template fix ships with the next `X.Y.Z` tag.

## Pinning Terraform module versions in GitOps

When configuring GitOps repositories, pin companion Terraform modules using the exact SemVer Git tag:

```hcl
module "gke_cluster" {
  source       = "git::https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents.git//terraform/modules/gke-cluster?ref=0.3.0"
  project_id   = var.project_id
  cluster_name = "production-host-01"
  location     = "us-central1"
}
```
