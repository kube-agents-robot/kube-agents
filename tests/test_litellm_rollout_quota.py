"""Tests that a LiteLLM rollout can finish under a full namespace quota (#749).

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'

Stdlib unittest, no pytest, matching the other suites in this directory.

`maxUnavailable: 0` on a Deployment makes the surge Pod mandatory: the old
ReplicaSet may not shrink until the new Pod is available, so where a namespace
`ResourceQuota` has no room for one more Pod the surge Pod is refused with
`FailedCreate` and the rollout never completes. It does not degrade — it stops,
until `progressDeadlineSeconds`, including the rollout carrying whatever fix
prompted it.

Some organizations apply a baseline quota to every namespace as policy, and
nothing in this repository creates or sizes that quota, so the harness cannot
assume headroom exists. `maxUnavailable` of at least 1 is what lets the rollout
fall back to replacing in place.

LiteLLM's Deployment exists in four files, and the value has to hold in the
three that roll. Only two are the pair `AGENTS.md` keeps in step on purpose:

    charts/kube-agents/templates/litellm.yaml   (via values.yaml, configurable)
    k8s-operator/config/integrations/litellm/base/deployment.yaml  (dev path)
    examples/litellm-gemini/deployment.yaml     (starting template, reached
                                                 from four docs-site pages)
    examples/litellm-chatgpt-subscription/deployment.yaml  (Recreate, so it
                                                 takes no surge Pod and cannot
                                                 hit this at all — exempt by
                                                 construction, not by omission)

Nothing else asserts this. `make chart-check` covers the CRD, RBAC,
admission-policy and webhook manifests, not the integration Deployments, and
`test_gateway_rollout_budgets.py` reads the CI rollout gate rather
than the Deployment's strategy — so before this suite the fix could be reverted
in any one of them with every gate still green.

The gateway Deployment reaches the same trap through a percentage that rounds
down; that side is the operator's and is covered by the Go table test in
`k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers_test.go`.

Scope this suite covers specifically: the LiteLLM Deployment family. Other
Deployments the install ships are tested by `test_deployments_rollout_quota.py`.
