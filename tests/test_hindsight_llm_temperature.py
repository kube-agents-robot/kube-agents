"""The hindsight-api LLM temperature contract, in both manifest copies.

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'

Stdlib unittest, no pytest, matching the other suites in this directory.

Hindsight sends a `temperature` on every LLM call it makes. A model that
refuses an explicit one answers 400, which reaches the agent as
`500 Fact extraction failed` — a retain that stores nothing while reporting a
server error, so memory is inert for the whole install rather than degraded.
`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE=none` is Hindsight's own sentinel for omitting
the parameter; the rationale, and what the omission costs, is in `api.yaml`'s
comment beside the variable.

The Deployment exists twice on purpose: `k8s-operator/config/integrations/`
is the dev path and `charts/kube-agents/templates/` is what an install renders.
They are kept in step by hand, and `make chart-check` does not cover them — it
guards the CRD, RBAC, admission-policy and webhook manifests, not the
integration Deployments. So losing the variable from either copy is a silent
edit whose symptom appears only on whichever install path lost it, which is
what this pins.

The chart copy is read as text rather than parsed: it is a Helm template, and
its `{{ }}` actions are not YAML.
